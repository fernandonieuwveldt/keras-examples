# Keras Examples

This project contains Keras examples. It will be updated as new examples are added

## Below find a list of examples currently available with a short description:

- lambda_layer_engineering/lambda_layer_engineering.ipynb:
    * In this notebook we showcase how to apply feature engineering using Keras Lamba layers.


- feature_engineering_custom_layers/feature_engineering_using_custom_layers.ipynb:
    * Similar to the lambda_layer_engineering notebook, but here we will use custom layers for each feature transformation. We using custom layers to overcome the serialization limitation of Lambda layers


- single_custom_layer/single_custom_layer.ipynb:
    * In the feature_engineering_using_custom_layers notebook we use different custom layers for feature engineering. In this notebook we a implement single layer for engineering features.
